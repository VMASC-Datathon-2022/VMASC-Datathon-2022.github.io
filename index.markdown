[Team Virginia Modeling, Analysis, & Simulation Center (VMASC)](https://vmasc.org)

Created as part of the [Hampton Roads Datathon 2022: Analyzing, Promoting, and Protecting Biodiversity in Hampton Roads](https://data.norfolk.gov/stories/s/Hampton-Roads-Datathon/wk4d-6jxs/) from September 9-16, 2022 and hosted by *CivicLab Norfolk*.

Trees serve an important role in providing protection from the natural elements, such as providing cooler spots to rest during the hot portions of the day and helping to stay out of direct sunlight to reduce the risk of sunburn. Exposure to high temperatures and high humidity can lead to heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke. A contributing risk factor to the occurrence of heat exhaustion is a high heat index of 91 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Trees provide assistant in this instances by providing shade and lowering the perceived air temperature.

For the datathon, we explore the benefits provided by trees identified as significant within the city of Norfolk within the Hampton Roads area. Additionally, we also look at the locations of newly planted tress as part of the City of Norfolk's tree planting program that plants trees on city owned property. Data and categorization of significant trees in Norfolk, VA are collected by volunteers with the Norfolk Master Gardeners. Visualizations and analyses are conducted at the census tract level within the city to provide insights into the geographical distribution of tree across the city. Our solution is divided into three sections: (i) visualization of significant and planting tree program trees by census tract in Norfolk, VA, (ii) a simulation exploring the effects of heat exposure and the role of Norfolk's significant trees on pedestrians, and (iii) analytics highlighting the breakdown of trees within each census tract and highlighting the findings from the simulation runs.
