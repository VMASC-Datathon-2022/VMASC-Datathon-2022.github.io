<h1 style="text-align:center">Significant Trees and Heat Exposure for Census Tracts in Norfolk, VA Shiny Application</h1>

The *Significant Trees and Heat Exposure for Census Tracts in Norfolk, VA* app facilitates exploration of trees identified as significant within the city of Norfolk within the census tracts that they reside. Additionally, our app provides exploration of each simulated individuals' distance traveled within two scenarios of an exposure simulation. The app is divided into three parts:


	
1. **Significant Trees:** this provides insights into the number of trees, types of trees, and average canopy spread within each census tract. 
	
2. **Exposure Simulation Runs Results:** this provides insights into distance each simulated agent traveled and the corresponding amount of shade that each individual encountered during their travel.
	
3. **Heat Exposure Simulation Testing:** this this section posits a heat index value for the city and then provides insights into the simulated agents (same as from the Exposure Simulation Runs Results section) corresponding perceived heat index based on their exposure to tree shade
