<h1 style="text-align:center">Visual Representation of Significant Trees by Census Tract in Norfolk, VA</h1>

<p>We utilized QGIS to create visual representations of the Significant Trees and the future trees from the Tree Planting Program within the city of Norfolk. Maps representing (i) the locations of Significant Trees (today) based on information collected by volunteers with the Norfolk Master Gardeners, (ii) significant and planted trees as part of the City of Norfolk's Tree Planting Program, and (iii) significant and planted trees using their fully grown estimate sizes for canopy widths. Trees are color-coded based on their canopy widths.</p>
